# Watt's Up with Electric Vehicles? Building the Path to Sustainable EV Adoption 

Material for the "Watt's Up with EVs?" workshop, presented at the Grace Hopper Celebration 2024.

This material covers three hands-on exercises:

- Exercise 1: simulate an EV using model-based design.
- Exercise 2: predict battery cycle life using machine learning.
- Exercise 3: solve for a smart charging solution using optimization. 


## Get Started

To participate in the workshop, you need:  

- Laptop 
- Google Chrome&trade; browser 
- MathWorks&reg; account 

We will provide you with a temporary workshop license. This license gives you access to all products that the workshop uses, as well as workshop exercise files. 

## Step I. Set Up Your MathWorks Account  

A MathWorks account is required to access MATLAB&reg; Online&trade; and the material for this event. Log in to your MathWorks account or, if you don’t have one, create one [here](https://www.mathworks.com/login?uri=%2Fmwaccount%2F). You will need access to your email on the machine you are using to create the account.  

## Step II. Activate Workshop License  

The workshop uses MATLAB Online. You must activate the workshop license to participate. 
1. Using Google Chrome, navigate to the workshop license link provided as part of the workshop. If you are not already logged in to your MathWorks account, do so.
2. Click ``Access MATLAB Online``.
   
You can activate this license starting from the day of the workshop up to a week after the workshop date. 

To run these exercises without workshop license, you will need: 
- MATLAB&reg;
- Simulink&reg;
- Powertrain Blockset&trade;
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox&trade;
- Optimization Toolbox&trade;

## Step III. Access Exercise Files 

MATLAB Online will try to automatically port over your workshop files from GitHub. You will see a dialog pop-up for saving and opening the repository of files.  

1. Click on the checkbox to accept outside source code. 
2. To access the files, click ``Save and Open``. 

## Step IV. Verify Your Environment and Setup Your Exercises

To verify that your environment is correctly set up for the exercises: 
1. In the MATLAB Online Command Window: >> setup 
2. Confirm that the welcome message is displayed

## Try Out the Exercises! 

We are looking forward to your participation in this workshop!
