# Watt's Up with Electric Vehicles? Building the Path to Sustainable EV Adoption 

Material for the "Watt's Up with EVs?" workshop, presented at the Grace Hopper Celebration 2024.

This material covers three hands-on exercises:

- Exercise 1: simulate an EV using model-based design.
- Exercise 2: predict battery cycle life using machine learning.
- Exercise 3: solve for a smart charging solution using optimization. 


## Get Started

To participate in the workshop, you need:  

- Laptop 
- Google Chrome&trade; browser 
- MathWorks&reg; account 

We will provide you with a temporary workshop license. This license gives you access to all products that the workshop uses, as well as workshop exercise files. 

## Step I. Set Up Your MathWorks Account  

A MathWorks account is required to access MATLAB&reg; Online&trade; and the material for this event. Log in to your MathWorks account or, if you don’t have one, create one [here](https://www.mathworks.com/login?uri=%2Fmwaccount%2F). You will need access to your email on the machine you are using to create the account.  

## Step II. Activate Workshop License  

The workshop uses MATLAB Online. You must activate the workshop license to participate. 
1. Using Google Chrome, navigate to \[LINK TBD\] . If you are not already logged in to your MathWorks account, do so.
2. Click ``Access MATLAB Online``.
   
You can activate this license starting from the day of the workshop up to a week after the workshop date. 

To run these exercises without workshop license, you will need: 
- MATLAB&reg;
- Simulink&reg;
- Powertrain Blockset&trade;
- Simscape&trade;
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox&trade;
- Optimization Toolbox&trade;

## Step III. Access Exercise Files 

MATLAB Online will try to automatically port over your workshop files from GitHub. You will see a dialog pop-up for saving and opening the repository of files.  

1. Click on the checkbox to accept outside source code. 
2. To access the files, click ``Save and Open``. 

## Step IV. Verify Your Environment and Setup Your Exercises

To verify that your environment is correctly set up for the exercises: 
1. In the MATLAB Online Command Window: >> setup 
2. Confirm that the welcome message is display

## Try Out the Exercises! 

We are looking forward to your participation in this workshop!
